            <p class="text-muted text-left"> The Louvre, or the Louvre Museum, is the world's second-largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France, and is best known for being the home of the Mona Lisa. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum was closed for 150 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 72 percent to 2.7 million. Nonetheless, the Louvre still topped the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2020.</p>

            <h5 class="text-sucess text-left text-capitalize"> one very famous tower in france</h5>
            <p class="text-muted text-left"> The Eifel Tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200 meter and 300 meter mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.</p>

   <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

            Qibli knows Darkstalker must be stopped. And he knows he could stop him -- if he had magic. With even a sliver of the ancient dragon's all-powerful scroll, Qibli could rewrite history the right way: end war forever; make every dragon happy; perhaps even cast a very small spell so that everyone would like him . . . Instead, as Darkstalker's dangerous influence spreads across Pyrrhia, entrancing or killing every dragon in the seven tribes, Qibli can only grasp the small animus objects he's borrowed from Turtle. With some clever thinking, Qibli's talons finally hold the power to make a difference. But prophecies are not easy to rewrite. Can Qibli be the magical force Pyrrhia needs, or will he be the one to bring Jade Mountain -- and his family, his friends, his whole world -- crashing down? </p>

            <p>Amazon Review: This book was so so so amazing! Sutherland made each chapter build and grow on each other like a skyscraper that keeps getting higher and higher. I loved how this book was so creative with the different villains. It added a lot of suspense to the story. I also thought it was so cool how Sutherland made the prologue all mysterious, and it's only explained near the end. Another thing I cherished about this book is how Sutherland talked about Qibli's backstory, something we've kind of been kept in suspense about since Book 1. Overall, I loved this book and, in general, the Wings of Fire series.</p>

            <p> Blue the SilkWing is content. Life in his Hive is safe; he loves his family; he has enough to eat. And Pantala has been at peace for as long as he can remember -- SilkWings and HiveWings live and work together in harmony, and because they stay vigilant, no one has seen a dangerous LeafWing in years. Now that Blue's sister, Luna, is undergoing her Metamorphosis, Blue knows things are going to change. Luna will have her wings and her silk, be assigned a partner and a work order, and move to another Hive. A few days later, Blue's own wings and silk will come in. But nothing could prepare Blue for what happens when Luna's wings start to grow. Suddenly his world is turned upside down, throwing him into dangers he never knew existed. Pantala isn't as peaceful as it seems, and Blue isn't safe. Whether he's ready or not, it's time to adapt -- and fight for his life.... </p>

            <p>Amazon Review: This is the eleventh book in the Wings of Fire series and starts a new storyline on a new continent we have never visited before. Although some of the story elements are very similar to previous books, I did really enjoy meeting new characters and exploring both whole new types of dragons and a whole new landscape. I continue to read these, and I actually really enjoyed this book! This book starts with a prequel featuring Clearwater and her journey across the seas to a new continent of Dragons. The new continent is called Pantala. There are new types of dragons on Pantal including HiveWings, LeafWings, and SilkWings. After this prequel we journey many centuries into the future where a SilkWing named Blue is preparing for his Metamorphosis along with his sister Luna. This book introduces a whole bunch of new dragon types and some great new fun characters. I loved Blue with his quiet tentativeness and Cricket with her non-traditional HiveWing views.</p>

            Snowfall didnt expect to be queen of the IceWings at such a young age, but now that she is, she's going to be the best queen ever. All she has to do is keep her tribe within IceWing territory, where it's safe while keeping every other tribe out, where they belong. Its a perfect and simple plan, backed up by all the IceWing magic Snowfall can find. That is, until a storm of unidentified dragons arrives on her shore, looking for asylum. The foreigners are completely strange and, Snowfall is certain, utterly untrustworthy. But as she escorts the miserable new tribes out of her kingdom, Snowfall is forced to reconsider her plan. Maybe she can only keep her tribe safe... if she's willing to risk everything. </p>

            <p>Amazon Review: I think I felt a special fondness for this book and the protagonist because we get to see someone a position where they wondered if they were ready for it and always wondering how others think they are doing, grow as the book progresses. We also get answers to stuff from prior books. I would say without spoiling too much, but you should read both Darkstalker and Dragonslayer as there are references in this book (or maybe you want to read up on what people are referencing?). Other than that, there's not too much to add - this is the 14th book in the series and the 4th book in the third "arc" so you should've at least read books 11 - 13 (since they are definitely tied to this book) and know what to expect. Personally, I think this is one of the better written books in the series (not that I would say any are outright poorly written/bad - flawed? yeah, but not bad). I think the protagonist is one of my favorites simply because they were relatable - again a young character forced into a role they weren't expecting with doubts associated to it and having to grow. I can't wait to see the conclusion to everything in book 15 and see if there are any more books expected - because I don't feel like I've hit the wall with the series yet.</p>
